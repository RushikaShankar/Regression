# Regression Analysis Overview

## Introduction
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Different types of regression are used depending on the nature of the data and the problem being solved.

## Types of Regression

### 1. Linear Regression
Linear regression models the relationship between variables using a straight line. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
An extension of linear regression, multiple linear regression involves more than one independent variable to predict the dependent variable.

### 3. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression fits the data using a polynomial equation, allowing for non-linear relationships between variables.

### 4. Logistic Regression
Used for classification problems, logistic regression predicts categorical outcomes (e.g., yes/no, 0/1).

### 5. Ridge Regression
Ridge regression addresses multicollinearity by adding a penalty term to shrink coefficients, improving model stability.

### 6. Lasso Regression
Similar to ridge regression, lasso regression can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting important variables.

### 7. Elastic Net Regression
Elastic net regression combines ridge and lasso regression, making it useful when features are highly correlated.

### 8. Stepwise Regression
Stepwise regression involves adding or removing predictors based on their statistical significance, refining the model.

### 9. Quantile Regression
Quantile regression estimates conditional quantiles rather than the mean, useful for modeling distributions beyond averages.

### 10. Robust Regression
Robust regression is designed to handle outliers that might distort results in traditional regression models.

### 11. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
SVR uses support vector machines principles for continuous predictions, making it effective in complex datasets.

### 12. Decision Tree Regression
Decision tree regression employs tree-based structures to model relationships and make predictions.

## Conclusion
Each type of regression has its strengths and ideal applications. Selecting the right regression model depends on the nature of the data and the problem being solved.
